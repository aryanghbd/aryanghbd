- 👋 Hi, I’m @aryanghbd - I'm a recent graduate of Computer Engineering (4Y MEng) from Imperial College London.
- 👀 I’m interested in low-latency C/C++, high-performance and embedded computing along with FPGAs, distributed systems and full-stack development on the side.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift, delving into Rust and C# for fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything.
- 📫 How to reach me - Reach out to me on LinkedIn (Aryan Ghobadi), or just to chat really, always looking to make some new friends in the industry :)
